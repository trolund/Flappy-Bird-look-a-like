# Flappy bird look a like game with AI

This quick-start project combines Phaser 3 with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) for bundling.

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm run watch` | Build project and open web server running project, watching for changes |
| `npm run dev` | Builds project and open web server, but do not watch for changes |
| `npm run build` | Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, no source maps, etc..) |

## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development
server by running `npm run watch`. The first time you run this you should see the following demo run:

## Configuring Rollup

* Edit the file `rollup.config.dev.js` to edit the development build.
* Edit the file `rollup.config.dist.js` to edit the distribution build.
